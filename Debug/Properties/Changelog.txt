Changelog:

16.12.2020: V2.2.6.7
Bugfix:
 - Changed hex-conversion of MOVE-driver (SetPositionAbs-Method) from upper- (X) to lowercase (x) (Thx @ Christoph Langer & Dominik Berndt)

16.06.2020: V2.2.6.6
Bugfix:
 - Fixed load ini error. An exception occured when loading a second ini due to the implementation of a information-dictionary which was not cleaned due to chart-wipe

09.06.2020: V2.2.6.5
Feature:
 - Added min and max for the chart-axis. This is a beta-feature! Both values have to be given and are only allowed with @min, @max!
Bugfix:
 - Added "Open Ini", "Open sweep", "Save last results" and "Check for updates" button to disabled buttons while measurement is ongoing.
 - Fixed Stop-Request flag of RobertMode. It was not reset when it was requested once!
 - Added "CustomName" and "InstantMeasurement=-1" feature to DMM7510-Overlay. It was not done when that feature was implemented first.
Misc:
 - Renamed the internally used object-names of the menu-strip-items (File-button, etc...).
 - In order to implement the min/max feature for the chart axis, the entire internally data-management of the configuration-content (ini-dataset) was reinvented (datastorage classes).


22.05.2020: V2.2.6.4
Bugfix:
 - VD9x driver closes now the serial port before throwing an timeout-exception when trying to access the device firstly.
 - VD9x default.ini standard-baud changed from 9600 to 115200. Led to timout-exceptions.
 - MOVE1250 driver fixed. When there is no position response at first communication, a more understandable error-message will be shown.
 

14.05.2020: V2.2.6.3
Feature:
 - Added external AutoUpdater to application (tested). Updaterbutton is available under "FEMDAQ->Info->Check for Updates".
Bugfix:
 - VD9x driver closes now the serial port before throwing an timeout-exception when trying to access the device firstly.
 - VD9x timeout-limit expanded. Has led multiple times to timeout-exceptions.


11.05.2020: V2.2.6.2
Feature:
 - Improved saveprogress-dialog. It shows now the amount of devices which already have saved!
 - Changed the dialog-answers from the "folder not found" when loading a queue-file in the job-queue-frame from Yes/No to Yes/No/Cancel in order to use the escape-key as "no/cancel".
 - Added "Robert-Mode" to change the default Job-Queue behaviour. When this mode is active (green backgrounded) it asks for repeating the last job or continuing/aborting the queue.
Bugfix:
 - Added exception to "AssignSweep"-Method of the layers! Otherwise there could be a logial program-freeze!
 - Information of the ini-log appends now instead of being written where the cursor is placed.
Misc:
 - Added a "DeviceName"-Property to InstrumentLogicalLayer-Interface. The name will build as "<DevXY>|<Customname>" when a Customname is given. In case of no CustomName is given "<DevXY>|<DeviceType>" will returned.
 - Changed the faculty-logo of the splashscreen.
 - Changed the MessageBox output messages for stop-requests from the JobQueue.


09.12.2019: V2.2.6.1

12.11.2019: V2.2.5.9
Bugfix:
 - Changed the default-value for a non-given drawnover to time! (Otherwise the RTO will generate an exception)

29.10.2019: V2.2.5.7
Feature:
 - Added background-support for saving measurementdata.
    Saveroutine needs an additional callback for the GUI-Invoke to mark a job as done when using the JobQueue.
 - Added saving-popup while measurementdata is saved! While saving the entire GUI will be blocked! Has actually no updatemechanism for the details of saving!
Bugfix:
 - Changed save-routine of RTO. Too big amount of measurementpoints led to out of memory exception. Now one entire waveform gets attached to the file to save RAM!
 - Fixed program-title change which changed the program-title! The title form is now "FEMDAQ V2 (Build: w.x.y.z) - Title: <Ini-Title>".
Misc:
 - Changed order of crash-handling. The steps are now following:
    1.) A crash-message appears with the exception-details
	2.) A fatalException folder will be created and a log will be stored there.
	3.) Try to save the actual results
	3.1) When the save fails, another crash-message appears and saves a second log to the fatalException folder. Otherwise the tools closes itself without a second message!


28.10.2019: V2.2.5.6
Bugfix:
 - Added try-catch blocks to the dispose method of instruments with sources! They created a exception when the device was turned off before FEMDAQ was closed!
 - Fixed RTO Samplerate-Exception by workaround which sets Recordlength instead.


17.10.2019: V2.2.5.5
Features:
 - Added changelog-file to execution directory with a program link to open it from FEMDAQ itself (Help -> Changelog)
