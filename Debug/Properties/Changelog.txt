Changelog:

XX.YY.ZZZZ: V2.2.8.4
Feature:
 - Added special window for PyCam2 as status monitor, showing roughly the current carried out actions. Log is not saved -> Use the detailed log of the PyCam2 itself!
   (currently not completely finished all log-lines)


14.07.2023: V2.2.8.3
Feature:
 - Added possibility to execute commands once per measurement-start to InstrumentOverlay
Fixed:
 - SerialPort-object of FEAR16v12 was static (now it's an instance-variable). That caused problem on re-init a port when turned off and on again!
 - PyCam-Layer now resets its "MeasureCalls" and clears the temp-directory using the "exectue once before and after measurement" feature (see above).
 - PyCam2 Driver got own SCPClient-instance on download (using the same scpclient in different threads caused problems, due to scp already in use sometimes!)
 - PyCam2-Layer: Restructured the way of archiving (in "linear" code) and downloading (as thread)!
Misc:
 - Changed default height for "Log-Window" and "Sweepfile"
 - Changed default pin state of the left chart-panel to pinned


02.03.2023: V2.2.8.2
Feature:
 - Added PiCam2 Support (fully tested)
 - Added ADC:NMEAN X to mean X points. When using ADC:GET CF/UDRP Ch# the meaned value is returned
 - Added ADC_MDELT X to define the ms-deltatime between sample points. Combined with ADC:NMEAN you can define the meaning-time. E.g. default is: 4Pnts * 25ms = 100ms meaning time
Fixed:
 - Fixed the commented "Autostart PyCamServer.py" code-lines in PiCam.cs
 - Removed problemcatic "ChangeBaudrate"-code. Currently it just does nothing!

14.02.2022: V2.2.8.1
Fix:
 - A wrong number of "PicsPerSS" was sent to the camera (amount of shutterspeeds). Therefore a new option "PicsPerSS=" were added to default.ini PiCam-Block
Feature:
 - Added options to PiCam-Driver
    AnalogGain/DigitalGain (AG/DG) values can be given now. If both values given, ISO will be ignored! ISO is a weird value which the sensor uses to determine AG/DG by itself
    SensorMode added to change the sensormode (active pixels, binning, etc...)
 - Added possibility to adjust FrameRate by setting "FrameRate=" option in default.ini PiCam-Block
    0:  PiCam adjusts automatically to fastest possible Framerate
    >0: PiCam-Framerate is fixed
 - Added "Bayer=<bool>" option to PiCam
Misc:
 - Added a "DownloadFile"-Function to get rPiHQCam.log-file from server.


27.10.2022: V2.2.8.0
Bugfix:
 - Due to change to multi-threading the GPIB-devices other (not GPIB-devices) can request multiple queries at a time. That can lead to an exception of the GPIB-drivers.
   Therefore the GPIB-devices must be locked everytime they write/read/query data. This fix was currently on applied to MCP140-driver (and only partially).
 - When a tar.gz of PiCam is opened by the user, FEMDAQ can't move it to it's location directory. Now this is checked an a messagebox with a warning appears.
   This has also big influence on queues, because also there that warning can appear an block the chain!

 Misc:
 - Added some stats and flags to PiCamUnpacker.py
 - Added kedmm7510_64.dll to references for DMM7510-USB-Support
 - Slight changes on default.ini
 - Tried to implemented Cancel on "Create new folder if not exists" of JobQueue.
   Already implemented: Yes - Creates one cell folder
                        No  - Ignores one cell folder and marks red
   New Implementation: Cancel - Ignores like no but keeps the decision for all savefolder-cells
   !!!CODE IS CURRENTLY NOT SUPPOSED TO SUPPORT THAT FEATURE!!! (logical reasons! -> Commented for the moment)


05.08.2022: V2.2.7.9
Bugfix:
 - PiCam-Server writes 4 or 5 lines to rPiHQCam.log depending on if scripts starts the first time (4 lines) after the pi-boot or is restarted (5 lines)!
   This is caused by unmounting the RAMDisk and that led to a "socket not created" message within FEMDAQ.
 - Moved the kill-code for the PiCam-Script into a separate function
 - Fixed that "StopMeasureLogic" (and therefore saving) is called twice. This appeared due to when StopMeasureLogic is invoked by a finished job (Sweep-LineOverflow event).
   The invoke needs time wherein the MeasureManager is able to invoke StopMeasurelogic a second time. This leads to saving twice and because of the SavingPopup an unhandled
   exception occurs which crashes FEMDAQ. Fixed this by adding a WaitOne before going for the first CancellationToken-Check!
 - Added option "PictureInterval" which describe the deltatime between pictures. When exceeding this limit, the cam goes on when the shutterspeed is within a +-5% window of
   the target SS value.
 - Adjusted Intervaltime of the PiCAM SEQFET command to 3s, due to the "took to long"-message
 - Fixed reset of PiCam-measureCalls value, so that at each start a BlackSubtraction-Picture-Set is done (not only on the very first one after loading an INI).
 - Added some missing initializations of PiCam
 - Fixed missing baudrate-parsing within the "ComParser". Always set 300 baud (seems to be forgot to remove when did Move1250 implementation)
 - Added temporarily a flag to avoid double saving -> Needs to be observed and fixed correctly later on!
Misc:
 - Adjusted default.ini comment for IP
 - Added python script for sweep-columns with logarithmic spacing
 - Added python script for automatic PiCam-tar.gz-extraction
 - Added first version of Python SweepGenerator
 

26.07.2022: V2.2.7.8
Bugfix:
 - Fixed Cancellation problem (secure source state not called all the time)
 - Fixed problem with FEAR16 internal _serialPort management.
 - FEAR16 driver added 2x a list for it's sweep-values
 - FEAR16 driver used wrong list-count for checking if the given sweep-values are in range
 - PiCam driver: Changed the method for making pictures
 - MeasureManagerTask was not waked up by Token.Set() function. Reduced the SleepTime for waiting for finish of the measuretask worked for now! Needs more time to check why this happened really!
 - MOVE1250 was changed to force use Baudrate 300. This was modified in default.ini, but not in the InfoBlock-Parser! -> Fixed to Baud = 300 (always)
 - Due to the change to Multi-Threading, all threads were tried to stop by the GUI-Mainthread. Due to there are 2 threads watching and resetting the "finished"-ReturnEvents simultaneously, both Threads (main- and measureManager-Thread) one of the threads waits forever!
   -> Fix: Main-Thread stops the measure-manager and the measure-manager stops the measure-threads
   -> Following Problem: When the measurement was done correctly the sources not turned off (only when aborted by the user)
      This was due to the "MeasureManager-Task" was invoking "StopMeasureLogic" and then it breaked and therefore stopped itself. Due to the "MeasureManager" is now taking care of shutting down the MeasureTasks it was cancelled before receiving the CancellationToken-signal and therefore it hasn't cancelled the MeasureTasks which are turning off the sources!
Misc:
 - Weird crash-error after some time (mostly 30minutes) was found in energy options of windows. Changed again back to .NET 4.8.
 - Removed old code parts (kept as commentaries) from the pre-multithreading time
 - Changed the order of saving files. If ini or swp was renamed during measurement, the tool crashes without saving the important stuff!
 - Added try-catch when FEMDAQ tries to copy Ini or Swp files so that it just ignores the copy with an error-message instead of crashing.
 - Changed back to .NET 4.5.2 (maybe the NI4882.dll driver can't work with newer .NET-Frameworks; There was a change to .NET 4.8 due to native tuple-support, but this was rolled back to test if this causes the driver-crashes)

04.05.2022: V2.2.7.7
Bugfix:
 - MeasurementManagerTask was not waked up when measurement is stopped by "StopMeasureLogic" -> Added extra wake after setting it's cancellation

22.04.2022: V2.2.7.6
Feature:
 - Full MultiThreading support (one task for each device)
  -> Problem: GPIB not supporting simultaneous communication with >1 devices
  -> Solution: Introduced InstrumentCommunicationPHY-enumeration property within the InstrumentLogicalLayer-interface to be able to collect (depending on the communication-type) devices in a list
               This list is used to create a separate measure-thread which measures it's device-list as a sequence (e.g. for GPIB!)

19.04.2022: V2.2.7.5
Feature:
 - Added PiCam-Support
Misc:
 - Switched from .NET 4.5 to .NET 4.8

01.03.2022: V2.2.7.4
Feature:
 - Added support for FEAR16v2 (haum@OTH)
 - Fully changed the basic way how measurements and source outputs are controlled
   -> Measure-Method from Interace "InstrumentLogicalLayer" takes now the getDrawnOver-method to handle that internally
   -> This enables FEMDAQ to handle devices with multiple measurement units
 - Using 3D-Lists for x/y-Results in InstrumentLayers
   -> Enables FEMDAQ to manage devices with:
     > Multiple Channels
	 > Multiple values per channel (e.g. 2 different currents/voltages)
	 for gauges, sources and combinations (e.g. SMUs)
Bugfix:
 - Fixed HP4145B driver-error: leading sign-character was clipped from response-string -> No negative numbers was returned to InstrumentLayer
 - Fixed the way measureInstantly is checked (caused by change of the basically measure-routine due to FEAR16 implementation)
 - Fixed a Bug where always measurements were done at cycle-start and cycle-end
Misc:
 - Changed MeasureInstantly-property from int to enum
 - Completely renrewed commentaries within default-INI-File

24.01.2022: V2.2.7.3
Feature:
 - Added support for FUG MCP140-2000 devices
Misc:
 - FUGHCP350 turns on channel during Init-step (instead of sending turn on each time a new value is sent)

24.03.2021: V2.2.7.2
Feature:
 - Added support to show/hide chart-legends.
Bugfix:
 - Fixed a format error when adding devicenames to Chasing-Plot-List
Misc:

 - Fixed ReadOnly-property-reset to false of "RunsFinished" column when queue is stopped.
 - Fixed dispose-Exception when GPIB listeners turned off before FEMDAQ was closed. (untested due to no device to test were available)
Misc:
 - Cleaned up old JobQueueStatus (boolean) code snippets

23.03.2021: V2.2.7.0
Feature:
 - Changed JobQueueStatus from boolean (on/off) to integer value (multiple iterations of a job can be executed)

22.03.2021: V2.2.6.9
Feature:
 - Added new INI-section [ToolSettings] and it's handling
 - Added INI-value "SaveResultsGrouped=" (results are saved in groups into a subfolder named by the timestamp)
 - Added INI error-handling for missing blocks (ToolInfo, SweepInfo, Timing) and duplicate device- and chart-blocks

16.03.2021: V2.2.6.8
Bugfix:
 - Changed JobQueue-Delimiter from ',' to ';'. ',' caused problems with filenames where a ',' is within the path-string.
 - Redone some changes from a try to use JobQueue with variable iterations of entries (Number of iterations of a line back to line on or off!). This problem will be solved in future!

16.12.2020: V2.2.6.7
Bugfix:
 - Changed hex-conversion of MOVE-driver (SetPositionAbs-Method) from upper- (X) to lowercase (x) (Thx @ Christoph Langer & Dominik Berndt)

16.06.2020: V2.2.6.6
Bugfix:
 - Fixed load ini error. An exception occured when loading a second ini due to the implementation of a information-dictionary which was not cleaned due to chart-wipe

09.06.2020: V2.2.6.5
Feature:
 - Added min and max for the chart-axis. This is a beta-feature! Both values have to be given and are only allowed with @min, @max!
Bugfix:
 - Added "Open Ini", "Open sweep", "Save last results" and "Check for updates" button to disabled buttons while measurement is ongoing.
 - Fixed Stop-Request flag of RobertMode. It was not reset when it was requested once!
 - Added "CustomName" and "InstantMeasurement=-1" feature to DMM7510-Overlay. It was not done when that feature was implemented first.
Misc:
 - Renamed the internally used object-names of the menu-strip-items (File-button, etc...).
 - In order to implement the min/max feature for the chart axis, the entire internally data-management of the configuration-content (ini-dataset) was reinvented (datastorage classes).


22.05.2020: V2.2.6.4
Bugfix:
 - VD9x driver closes now the serial port before throwing an timeout-exception when trying to access the device firstly.
 - VD9x default.ini standard-baud changed from 9600 to 115200. Led to timout-exceptions.
 - MOVE1250 driver fixed. When there is no position response at first communication, a more understandable error-message will be shown.
 

14.05.2020: V2.2.6.3
Feature:
 - Added external AutoUpdater to application (tested). Updaterbutton is available under "FEMDAQ->Info->Check for Updates".
Bugfix:
 - VD9x driver closes now the serial port before throwing an timeout-exception when trying to access the device firstly.
 - VD9x timeout-limit expanded. Has led multiple times to timeout-exceptions.


11.05.2020: V2.2.6.2
Feature:
 - Improved saveprogress-dialog. It shows now the amount of devices which already have saved!
 - Changed the dialog-answers from the "folder not found" when loading a queue-file in the job-queue-frame from Yes/No to Yes/No/Cancel in order to use the escape-key as "no/cancel".
 - Added "Robert-Mode" to change the default Job-Queue behaviour. When this mode is active (green backgrounded) it asks for repeating the last job or continuing/aborting the queue.
Bugfix:
 - Added exception to "AssignSweep"-Method of the layers! Otherwise there could be a logial program-freeze!
 - Information of the ini-log appends now instead of being written where the cursor is placed.
Misc:
 - Added a "DeviceName"-Property to InstrumentLogicalLayer-Interface. The name will build as "<DevXY>|<Customname>" when a Customname is given. In case of no CustomName is given "<DevXY>|<DeviceType>" will returned.
 - Changed the faculty-logo of the splashscreen.
 - Changed the MessageBox output messages for stop-requests from the JobQueue.

Misc:
 - Cleaned up code and comments a little bit.


29.10.2019: V2.2.5.7
Feature:
 - Added background-support for saving measurementdata.
    Saveroutine needs an additional callback for the GUI-Invoke to mark a job as done when using the JobQueue.
 - Added saving-popup while measurementdata is saved! While saving the entire GUI will be blocked! Has actually no updatemechanism for the details of saving!
Bugfix:
 - Changed save-routine of RTO. Too big amount of measurementpoints led to out of memory exception. Now one entire waveform gets attached to the file to save RAM!
 - Fixed program-title change which changed the program-title! The title form is now "FEMDAQ V2 (Build: w.x.y.z) - Title: <Ini-Title>".
Misc:
 - Changed order of crash-handling. The steps are now following:
    1.) A crash-message appears with the exception-details
	2.) A fatalException folder will be created and a log will be stored there.
	3.) Try to save the actual results
	3.1) When the save fails, another crash-message appears and saves a second log to the fatalException folder. Otherwise the tools closes itself without a second message!


28.10.2019: V2.2.5.6
Bugfix:
 - Added try-catch blocks to the dispose method of instruments with sources! They created a exception when the device was turned off before FEMDAQ was closed!
 - Fixed RTO Samplerate-Exception by workaround which sets Recordlength instead.


17.10.2019: V2.2.5.5
Features:
 - Added changelog-file to execution directory with a program link to open it from FEMDAQ itself (Help -> Changelog)
